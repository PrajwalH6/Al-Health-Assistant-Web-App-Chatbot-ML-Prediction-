I have done an AI-ML Diabeties detection Application, and added the chat bot the will help the user . And there is a csv dataset which will be retived and will be displayed by the chat-bot but I can not upload my project on git hub because , th rules of git hub are not permitting me to do so , as I have used API key to train the ML model from the openAI, so I am unable to upload my project
